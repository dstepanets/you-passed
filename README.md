- registers for the required exams; 
- receives a notification about being admitted.

**Administrator**: 
- inputs the marks for the exams that students registered to;
- confirms the admission of the best-ranking applicants for each major or all of them in a batch;
- also, Admin can add/remove majors and exams, edit data about them, change a user's role, etc.

All users can register, login, update their profiles.
